           <p>Hello. My name is Katherine Pitts, and I'm a full stack software developer. I got a degree in mechanical engineering and had a successful career in the biomedical industry for a few years. During this time I was exposed to software engineering in the field and realized its potential to help the community and create positive change. I left my mechanical engineering job and decided to pursue software development full time.</p>
           <p>I graduated from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp in July 2020 as a fullstack React developer. I also added in Java to enable me to create complex applications that solve real problems. If you think our goals and mission align, I would love to work with you. </p>
